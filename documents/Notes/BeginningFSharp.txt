What is F#
Inside the Preface parts on “What is F#”, it is discussed the family of Functional programming language. 

“Some of the most popular functional languages, including OCaml, Haskell, Lisp, and Scheme, have traditionally been implemented using custom runtimes, which leads to problems such as lack of interoperability. F# is a general-purpose programming language for .NET (a general-purpose runtime) that smoothly integrates all three major programming paradigms”

Literals, string, byte array, char, bool, int/int32,… sbyte..

Byte array: System.Byte[]: “bytebytebyte”B  

You cannot use lowercase ‘b’:
> "bytesbytesbytes"b;;

  "bytesbytesbytes"b;;
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

stdin(20,1): error FS0003: This value is not a function and cannot be applied
> "bytesbytesbytes"B;;
val it : byte [] =

stdin(66,1): error FS0784: This numeric literal requires that a module 'NumericLiteralN' defining functions FromZero, FromOne, FromInt32, FromInt64 and FromString be in scope

•	the notation of how to represent octal, hexadecimal and others are different from that in C#.

•	Also, it has added y,uy,n,I,s?”

Other differences:
1.	Can contain newline character..

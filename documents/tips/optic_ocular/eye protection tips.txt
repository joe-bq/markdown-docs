It has been common used that you can change the color of the window according to the recommendeation from the Optic/ccular specialist , and the color to be used is 
Hue: 85
Sat: 123
Lum: 205

and when that is translated to the Hex code, it is 
#c7edcc

you probably will want to add a plugin called "Change color" to Chrome, which then after enabled, you can use the CTL+SHIFT+G to enable globally
